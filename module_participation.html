<h5>Augmenting participation</h5>

We study environments to facilitate participation in events and spaces

<ul>
<li>development of Presemo and live participation practices</li>
<li>how performers integrate the audience input as part of the on-stage performance</li>
<li>challenges which emerge when mediated environments are brought to events</li>
</ul>

We analyze augmented participation in cross-disciplinary collaboration together with social scientists

<ul>
<li>digital media Influence Index measures how much the various digital footprints impact the media 
agenda</li>
<li>Automated Discourse Quality Index supports political scientists measuring deliberation by using 
computational text classification</li>
</ul>
